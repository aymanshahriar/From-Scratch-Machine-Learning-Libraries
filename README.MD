# From-Scratch Machine Learning Libraries

This repository contains machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using "pure" python, no external ML libraries are used. The code is intended to be readable and educationalâ€”clarity is prioritized over performance or brevity.

## Components

- **KNearestClassifier**: Implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for both regression and classification. Main logic in `KNearestNeighbors.py`.
- **LinearRegression**: Implements gradient descent-based linear regression. Main logic in `MyLinearModel.py`.

## Directory Structure

- `KNearestClassifier` and `LinearRegression` each have their own `README.md` and core implementation files.
- `KNearestClassifier/Test KNearestClassifier` and `KNearestClassifier/Test KNearestRegressor` contain test scripts and sample data for KNN models.
- `LinearRegression/Testing` contains test scripts and sample data for linear regression.

## Key Patterns & Conventions

- **No external ML libraries**: All algorithms are implemented from scratch, without scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.
- **Testing**: Test scripts are plain Python files (not using pytest/unittest). They are located in subfolders named `Test*` or `Testing/` and use sample CSVs for input data.
- **Data**: Test data is stored as CSV files alongside test scripts.
- **Model API**: Models expose `fit`/`predict` methods similar to scikit-learn, but with custom logic and attributes (e.g., `coef_`, `intercept_`).
- **Stopping Criteria**: Linear regression uses a precision-based stopping rule for gradient descent.

## Developer Workflows

- **Run tests**: Execute test scripts directly, e.g.:
	```bash
	python KNearestClassifier/Test\ KNearestClassifier/TestPredict.py
	python LinearRegression/Testing/TestModule.py
	```
- **Add new models**: Place new algorithm implementations in their own subfolders, following the pattern of existing modules.
- **Add tests**: Place test scripts and data in a `Test*` or `Testing/` subfolder within the relevant module.

## Examples

- KNN usage: See `KNearestClassifier/KNearestNeighbors.py` and `KNearestClassifier/Test KNearestClassifier/TestPredict.py`.
- Linear regression usage: See `LinearRegression/MyLinearModel.py` and `LinearRegression/Testing/TestModule.py`.

## Special Notes

- No package manager or requirements file; all code is pure Python.
- No formal test runner; tests are run as scripts.
