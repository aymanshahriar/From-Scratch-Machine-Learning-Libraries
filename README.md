# KNearest-Neighbors-Library-From-Scratch 🕃

Implementing K-Nearest Neighbor based regression and classification algorithms from scratch.

This module contains two machine learning models - a regression model and a classification model, both of which utilize K-Nearest Neighbors for predicting the targets.
