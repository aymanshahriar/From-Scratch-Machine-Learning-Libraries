# Linear-Regression-Library-From-Scratch 📈 📊 📉 💹 

Implementing gradient descent based linear regression from scratch (that optimizes the coefficients (m1, ..., mn) and slope (b) by minimizing the total loss function using gradient descent)

This module contains a self-made linear regression class has two attributes/variables: coef_ and intercept_

How many iterations of gradient descent should we perform?
Let us set a precision variable in our algorithm which calculates the difference between two consecutive “x” values .
If the difference between x values from 2 consecutive iterations is lesser than the precision we set, stop the algorithm !

The actual library is located in the file MyLinearModel.py
